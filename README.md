# TODO LIST
## A todo list made with React over Next.js

First, install dev dependences

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

### The project does
* Show a form to add items to the list.
* Each item in the list can be deleted independently.
* Keeps the list items when I return to the app after closing it, using localStorage.
* Simulates a delay when loading, saving and deleting elements, as if we were interacting with an external service, using Promise.
